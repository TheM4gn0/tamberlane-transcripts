BELFRY: The Taint allows creatures in Abroad to work with tools we can't.
BELFRY: So they make our plumbing go. And our running water!

TAMBERLANE: And the medicine.

BELFRY: Very good!
BELFRY: Yes, in Abroad, they have better medicine! And machines to help sick creatures.

BELFRY: But those things are full of Taint, too.
TAMBERLANE: So that's why you hafta choose if you get *bad*-sick.
BELFRY: Exactly.

BELFRY: But even when creatures go, even though they can't return, they can still help their friends and family!
BELFRY: By serving society from Abroad, you can still make a difference!

BELFRY: That's why we send bad guys there, too. So they can get better by helping!
BELFRY: Does that make sense?
