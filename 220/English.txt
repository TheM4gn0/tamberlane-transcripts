NARRATOR: Once, in a little town much like your own, Inquisitive Ivan lived happy at home. A curious boy, with a curious mind, He wanted to learn all the facts he could find!
NARRATOR: His poor Papa Padgett grew sick with the flu. The doctor said, "Sorry. There's naught I can do."
NARRATOR: But Pa whispered: "There is a beast in the Thicket That knows many things. That may be the ticket!"

NARRATOR: That night in the woods, amidst crawdads and crickets, The kit found the home of this Thing in the Thicket. A cave full of shadows, and whispers of dread, a dwelling where good little kits mustn't tread.
NARRATOR: "Oh child, do not be afraid," soothed a voice. "I give you a gift. I offer you *choice!* Your poor sickly Papa must come to my side. With all of my knowledge, I'll keep him alive!"

NARRATOR: "Who are you?" asked Ivan, with uneasy tummy. The voice answered softly, as sweetly as honey: "I hold all the knowledge that you've ever sought. It's lovely to meet you!
NARRATOR: Please call me **ABROAD**"

BELFRY: All I recalled was the nice pictures...
