CALLIE: My brilliant little darlings!
CUR: "Brilliant," she says. What even *is* an "ixport?"

CALLIE: And...?
TAMBERLANE: Because we're in the North!
CUR: Thanks, Captain Obvious.
CALLIE; Well done, luv!

MARIE: Oh, stuff it already!

CALLIE: Yes, Ellis, that's quite rude! We must *encourage* the younger learners!
CUR: Yes, *ma'am.*
CUR: And it's *Cur.*

KIRA: What's the big deal, anyway?
