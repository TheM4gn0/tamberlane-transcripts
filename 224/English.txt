BELFRY: No one thinks you're a monster.
BELFRY: Abroad is just...a bogeyman.
TAMBERLANE: So it's not real?
BELFRY: No, it's real. It's just...
BELFRY: Abroad is just a place, pet.

TAMBERLANE: Is *Taint* real?
BELFRY: Nana Tess says it is. But I don't think it's like *that.*

TAMBERLANE: It doesn't make monsters?
BELFRY: Well, *I've* never seen one, at least.

BELFRY: I don't know what it is about Taint that makes it so dangerous.
BELFRY: I know it's important to be careful; otherwise we wouldn't have so many rules around it!
BELFRY: I do know *some* things about Abroad, though!
TAMBERLANE: Like what?

BELFRY: Abroad is actually really important to Silver Sage!
BELFRY: It's because of Abroad that we have some important services here in Treehollow.
TAMBERLANE: Like what?

BELFRY: Like... Indoor plumbing!
BELFRY: If it weren't for Abroad, we'd have to poo outside!
TAMBERLANE: Ew!
