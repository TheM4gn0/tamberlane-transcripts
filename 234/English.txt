CALLIE: It's the *law,* Jason!

CALLIE: It's not like I could have kept the incident quiet!
CALLIE: Children *talk.* And then it would have gotten to the Council anyway!
CALLIE: That would have been even *worse!*

BELFRY: Makes sense! Two wrongs don't make a right, and all that.
JASON: Was what Jentzen did *wrong,* though?

BELFRY: Not *wrong,* exactly. But the Edicts are there for a reason, right?
BELFRY: Callie couldn't just *pretend* it never happened!

BELFRY: I mean, what would you expect her to do? *Lie?*

JASON: I feel like there's a world of options between lying and reporting Jentzen to the *authorities.*
BELFRY: "Authorities?"
BELFRY: Jason, you've really spent too much time away!
