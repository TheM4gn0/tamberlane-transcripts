BELFRY: You were so excited! Why not now?
TAMBERLANE: Cur...

BELFRY: Aw, don't worry, moppet. You'll be fine with your friends!

NORA: I'll look after you, Tamberlane. Okay?

JASON: And Miss Nora's a doctor! Nothing can go wrong with a doctor there, right?
TAMBERLANE: Right!

NORA: Tamberlane will be safe with me, Bel.
BELFRY: Thanks, Nora.

FINN: Alright, then, chaps. We're all packed. Load up!

BELFRY: I'll be in the cart ahead of you, okay? We'll meet up again at the Bluffs.
TAMBERLANE: Okay, Mummy, bye-bye.
