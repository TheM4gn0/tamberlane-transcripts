TESS: Belfry! Are you okay?

BELFRY: We're fine!

DOG: We? Who's we?

BELFRY: Me and this Tamberlane!

BELFRY: I mean- the ghost!

DOG: Is it really a ghost??

BELFRY: No, I don't think so. 
BELFRY: I think they're an abandoned kit.

DOG: An abandoned kit?!

DOG: Poor baby!
TESS: Henry, it's probably just a wild animal.
HENRY: But it's abandoned!
