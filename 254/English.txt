KIRA: Yeah, they called us your jerks!

KIRA: I'm my *own* jerk, thank you very much.

CUR: Whatever. Who cares about their dumb "ghost hunt" anyway?
KIRA: Man, we're never invited to *nothin'.*

JONAS: It's "anything."
KIRA: Huh?

JONAS: It should be "we're never invited to anything."

KIRA: Shut up, Jonas.
JONAS: Aggghhh!!! *Kira!!!*
