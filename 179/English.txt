TIMMOTHY: Our ancestors' brave sacrifices are what allow us to congregate from all over our fine country and celebrate our freedom!
TIMMOTHY: So please enjoy this year's Sovereign Festival! Sample some food, play some games, and enjoy our trades and fine goods!

TIMMOTHY: But as you celebrate, I urge you to remember Nairobi.
TIMMOTHY: I urge you to remember all of our ancestors.
TIMMOTHY: And consider...

TIMMOTHY: When life demands a sacrifice...

TIMMOTHY: ...and you must choose between love and duty...

TIMMOTHY: ...which will you choose?
