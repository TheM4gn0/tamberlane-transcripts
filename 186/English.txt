CALLIE: Th-that's enough, children!
CALLIE: So, w-when we go to Bally Bluffs, be sure to bring your best s-stories about your roots...

KIRA: Hey, Marie, you were right! She's *dodgin'* us!
[SFX: HAHAHA]

MARIE: Oh, *please,* Miss Callie, just tell us!

ANTHONY: Grown-ups make it sound so *terrifying*... 
PIPER: And *wicked!*

CALLIE: It is not wicked! We don't talk about...*that place.*
KIRA: Ever since Tamberlane got here, it's all you grown-ups *ever* whisper about!
CALLIE: Children, *please,* there is a time and a place for this! A-ask your parents!

ANTHONY: But why do some creatures *choose* to go there?

MARIE: How come being sick is just as bad as being a traitor?

PIPER: And why do you get Tainted so you can't come back?
