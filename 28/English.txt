AINSLEY: Alright, Oakewood! I'm doubling our usual bet.
AINSLEY: If you've never seen *anything* like it, we play chess on *my* time for two months.
AINSLEY: Otherwise, I owe *you* two months of priority scavenging.

OAKEWOOD: Not tonight, Ainsley.
OAKEWOOD: I already have plans.

OAKEWOOD: And those plans are a cozy, nice night in, away from the jibber-jabber of this overly imaginative little hamlet.

OAKEWOOD: And those plans start *now.*

AINSLEY: You'd throw me to the wolves?!
OAKEWOOD: Some of my best friends are wolves.
OAKEWOOD: *Goodnight.*
