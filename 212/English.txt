OAKEWOOD: Good morning, chaps.

SCOTT: It seems we have a party!
PEEK: Ah, come to fetch your books, Claude?
OAKEWOOD: Indeed, I have.
OAKEWOOD: And I believe Miss Tamberlane has some errands here, too. 

TAMBERLANE: Hi, Miss Scott!
SCOTT: Why hello there, Miss Tamberlane! What can I do for you?

TAMBERLANE: Mummy said...
TAMBERLANE: Mummy said I can have books.

BELFRY: We're looking for some books to help cheer her up after a rough day.

SCOTT: A rough day? We can't have *that,* now can we?
SCOTT: How about we pick some out?
TAMBERLANE: Yes, please!
