CALLIE: Over the next week, we'll be making our own projects about where we come from.

CUR: Miss Callie, some of us blokes don't *know* our roots!
CUR: We en't all cute little "ghosties" getting our *paw* helded!

CALLIE: Ellis! For the last time, *please* don't interrupt!
CUR: I en't *int'ruptin'!* I'm just *sayin'!* Why does *she* get soft-paws?

CALLIE: Tamberlane is still integrating into our class, Ellis! There's no need to be rude!

CUR: Well, I bet *she* wouldn't get in trouble for askin' questions! You'd just *answer 'em!*

CALLIE: You're *not* in trouble. But you must learn to treat your fellow classmates with respect!
CUR: I just wanna know what I'm s'posed to do for my project!
CALLIE: You may *both* write about your life here in Treehollow. Those are *your* roots.
CALLIE: Now, that's *enough.* If you have further questions, you may ask me after class.

CUR: Yes, *ma'am.*
