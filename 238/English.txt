JASON: *Anyway.*

JASON: It will probably be fine, Callie.
JASON: Just have a chat with the Council as soon as you can.
JASON: If Belfry's right, it'll all blow over.

CALLIE: Yes, absolutely. I'll do that immediately upon our return.

CALLIE: I hadn't... considered... how it would reflect on Jentzen when I made my report.
CALLIE: I was only following protocol...

BELFRY: It's merely a misunderstanding. I promise.
JASON: Yeah, it'll be fine.
JASON: Don't worry.
CALLIE: Thanks...
