MARIE: Oh, I hope she's okay...
MARIE: I've never seen her so upset!

ANTHONY: And *whose* fault is that?
PIPER: *Cur's!!* Why're you lookin' at *me?!*

PARSLEY: True, but...
PARSLEY: They weren't wrong, though, were they? You can be a right knob to your mates.
PIPER: What?! Some friend *you* are!

PARSLEY: As your friend, I'm just saying you should reconsider how you treat the creatures around you.
PENNY: He's right. You don't think about other creatures much.
ANTHONY: Or ever.
MARIE: You should... listen to them, Piper.

PIPER: But it's charming and adorable, right?

PIPER: Alright, *alright!!*
PIPER: I'll... work on it. Sorry...
