CALLIE: Alright, that's enough, children! Settle down! We're nearly done for the day.
CALLIE: Starting tomorrow, we're going to be exploring our roots!

TAMBERLANE: Roots? Like a tree?
TAMBERLANE: I have *roots?*
CALLIE: We all do, in a way!

CALLIE: Your roots are where you come from.

CALLIE: They're made up of our hometowns, our families, and even our ancestors!

CALLIE: Our roots make us who we are.

[SFX: OOF!]
MARIE: Aw, Tamberlane! Stop fretting!
MARIE: Your roots are right here in Treehollow!

PIPER: Yeah! You've been our infamous Rattleglen Ghostie for a whole year now!
PIPER: If those aren't roots, I dunno what is!
