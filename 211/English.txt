BELFRY: Well, we were on our way to Peek-a-Books, so...
OAKEWOOD: How fortuitous. So were we.

TAMBERLANE: We can go *together??*

OAKEWOOD: Oof!
OAKEWOOD: (hRGHHh) I think that's a splendid idea. 
OAKEWOOD: One can always find the truth between the covers of a book.

MILO: You okay?

BELFRY: Huh?
BELFRY: Oh, yeah...
BELFRY: I'm okay.

BELFRY: I'm just glad that at least *Oakewood* can cheer her up.
