TRISHA: That's a good question, Jason.
PIPER: The plan is *I get to hunt ghosts!*

TRISHA: Ghost hunting! Sounds like you'll need a proper base to start from.
PIPER: *Duh!* That's what *you guys* are for!

TRISHA: How about us grownups get the campsite set up all proper while you kits explore *outside* the ruins?

PIPER: *OUTSIDE?!* But the ghosts are *INSIDE!*
TRISHA: Some ghosts like to travel! I bet they've left clues outside.

PIPER: Ooo, *ghost clues!*
TRISHA: Then it's settled.
TRISHA: We'll get the campsite set while you hunt for 'ghost clues.'

TRISHA: ...And someone rescue Belfry, please.
