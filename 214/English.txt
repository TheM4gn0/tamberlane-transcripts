PEEK: Got your order in from Tangled Branch this morning.
OAKEWOOD: Excellent.

PEEK: Actually...
PEEK: I have something else you might be interested in.

OAKEWOOD: Oh?
PEEK: Yeah, I got this in a month ago...

PEEK: I did my best restoring and rebinding it, but it was tricky.
PEEK: This book is so old that it was nearly too degraded to recover.

OAKEWOOD: Alright, you've piqued my interest.
OAKEWOOD: What is it?

PEEK: An old relic a scavenger traded to my compatriot in Tangled Branch.
PEEK: Most of it's been destroyed, but...

PEEK: There were some things in here that I thought might interest you.
