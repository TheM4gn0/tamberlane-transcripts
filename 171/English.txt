BELFRY: I know the Great Outbreak wigged you lot out, but it's been *years.*
BELFRY: It's one thing to go to Abroad for treason. *Of course* you can't come back from *that.*
BELFRY: But we're talking about *treatment.*

BELFRY: *YOU WOULDN'T EVEN STAND UP FOR US?!*
TESS: Of *course* I would! You *know* I would!

TESS: If you choose to go to Abroad, it doesn't matter how hard I try.
TESS: Do you really think I didn't *try* to bring Koss and Jeremy back?
