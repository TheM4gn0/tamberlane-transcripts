PIPER: In a town not far from here lived poor Jackie Fleur.

PIPER: He was a young florist, our Jackie was.
PIPER: And like *lots* of florists, he was a romantic.

PIPER: He fell utterly in love with his customer, Miss Westfield.
PIPER: Oh, their love was *torrid!*
PIPER: And *passionate!*
TAMBERLANE (quietly): what's "torrid" mean?
MARIE (quietly): i dunno
PIPER: So of course, they were to be wed!

PIPER: But the moment the wedding bells rang, their passion *died!!*
PIPER: And Jackie told Miss Westfield that he didn't love her anymore.

PIPER: And *you know what she did?*

ANTHONY: She got a divorce?
PIPER: No, she *DIED!!!*
