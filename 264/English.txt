ANTHONY: She *died?* She can't have died from that!
PIPER: She died of *heartbreak,* Anthony! Where's your sense of *romance?*
ANTHONY: That's not romance, that's murder!

ANTHONY: That's a dumb story! It's not even spooky!
PIPER: I'm not *done,* Anthony, jeez!

PIPER: *Anyway.*
PIPER: She had a brightly colored wagon, and when Miss Westfield-Fleur died, Jackie couldn't stand to look at it.
PIPER: So he put it into storage.

PIPER: But it seemed that everywhere he went...
PIPER: The wagon *was there!*

PIPER: He couldn't get away from it! It followed him everywhere!
PIPER: Even to the *bathroom!*
ANTHONY (quietly): This is ridiculous.
