CALLIE: It's just... the topic of *That Place* came up during class.
BELFRY: Oh, no...
CALLIE: And I tried to steer the topic away but Jentzen was... insistent.

CALLIE: He was upset that I wasn't more... forthcoming.
CALLIE: And I...

CALLIE: I reacted...
CALLIE: Poorly.

CALLIE: I'm not proud. We argued in front of the *children!*
CALLIE: The poor things were *so* upset!

CALLIE: But he blindsided me! And the Edicts! We can't speak about it in class!
CALLIE: Perhaps if he had approached me in *private* first...

CALLIE: I didn't know what to do. I still don't.
CALLIE: I wish it had never happened.
