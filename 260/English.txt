PIPER: Here is our *plan of action!*

PIPER: We're gonna hunt the perimenter for *ghost clues.*
PIPER: Yes, Hattie?

HATTIE: What's a 'perimenter'?
PIPER: It's another word for *inside the chapel.* Duh!!
HATTIE (quietly): You didn't mean 'perimeter,' right?
HATTIE (quietly): Because that's not what that means at all...

ANTHONY: But Piper, the grown-ups said we had to stay outside-
PIPER: **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, ANTHONY, WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE?!**

PIPER: Okay. Ahem. Please 'scuse my outbursts.
PIPER: Now, where was I?

PIPER: Oh, sod it all!
PIPER: *LET'S HUNT GHOSTS!!!*
PIPER: ***CHARGE!!!***
