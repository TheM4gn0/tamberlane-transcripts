BELFRY: I'm just trying to keep her safe and happy.

NORA: You can't keep her safe from everything, Belfry! Certainly not her own emotions!

NORA: Remember when *we* were young? We were a couple of rebels!
BELFRY: But we were *teenagers,* not kits!

NORA: Oh, trust me, I was a little *tyrant* as a child, too.
NORA: You *can't* be telling me that you *never* needed space from Tess while growing up?

NORA: No matter what happens, remember: all Tam needs is love, someone to take responsibility for her...
BELFRY: ...and a safe place to land.

NORA: She'll be alright, Bel. You both will.
