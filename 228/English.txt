BELFRY: Once upon a time, there was a little bat who made lots of mistakes.

BELFRY: She felt like she was missing an important part that everyone else seemed to have.

BELFRY: But one day, she found a funny, wonderful little creature in the woods.
BELFRY: And even though everyone told her she couldn't, she took care of the little creature anyways.

BELFRY: And you know what she found out?
TAMBERLANE: what?

BELFRY: That little creature was the important part she was missing all along.

BELFRY: I love you, little Tamberlane.
TAMBERLANE: ...love you too, mummy...
