PEEK: I heard the kits are going to Bally Bluffs next week?
BELFRY: Yes! I hope to chaperone!

PEEK: Ah, excellent! In that case...
PEEK: There's good deal of limonite in the area, and I'm running low on my umber pigment.
PEEK: If you could just pop out and pick up a couple of orangey rocks from near the Bluffs, I'd consider us square!

BELFRY: Hmm... just *any* orangey rock?

PEEK: Any one will do.
PEEK: It may not be precisely what I need, but it'll be close enough to see me through until I can go myself. 

BELFRY: Deal! Even *I* can do that!

PEEK: Aces! Then you're all set to go, Miss Belfry!
SCOTT: Let me know if you have any more questions, okay, Tamberlane?
TAMBERLANE: Okay! Thank you, Miss Scott!
