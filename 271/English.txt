TRISHA: I wouldn't worry. Piper's leading them on a ghost hunt!

BELFRY: A ghost hunt?
TRISHA: Just a harmless spot of fun, Bel. Never you mind.

BELFRY: But Cur and his crew aren't part of it, right?
JASON: Come to think of it, I haven't seen those rascals since the sun started to set.

BELFRY: They're going to bully Tamberlane! I have to find them!
JASON: Now hold on a minute, Bel...

BELFRY: *No!* I made her a promise, and I'm going to *keep* it!

TRISHA: There she goes again.
JASON: Eh, she'll learn to let go eventually.
