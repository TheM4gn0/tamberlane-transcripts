NORA: How are you doing, Bel?

BELFRY: Absolutely *fabulous.*
NORA: I'm sure, you poor thing.

BELFRY: I made a mistake, but I don't even know what it *was!*
BELFRY: Now Tamberlane is so upset with me that she won't even *look* at me!

BELFRY: What did I do *this time??*

BELFRY: She's never pushed me away like that before...
