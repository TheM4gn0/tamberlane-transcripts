HONEY: Genevieve, have you seen Tess today?
GENEVIEVE: Last I saw, she was arguing with Belfry again.

HONEY: Of course she was.

TIMMOTHY: What now? Do we start the festival without the entire Council present?
GUNNER: We may have to.
GUNNER: Decision's yours, Timmothy.

TESS: I'm sorry!

TESS: I'm sorry I'm late!
TIMMOTHY: Oh thank goodness, no hard decisions today.

TIMMOTHY: Let's do this.
