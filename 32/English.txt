BELFRY: They're *not* a wild animal!
BELFRY: They're intelligent, like a creature!

BELFRY: And they're cold and scared and hurt and hungry

BELFRY: and worse, they're *abandoned!*

TESS: You have no way of knowing that! *It's* parents are probably off foraging!

BELFRY: They're tired, and hungry, and they're all alone in the rain! They've been abandoned, I'm *sure of it!*

TESS: Belfry, just leave the damn animal alone!
