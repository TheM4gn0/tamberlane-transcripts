# How to Submit Transcripts for Tamberlane

Each comic page has its own folder. If the comic page does not have a folder yet, when you click the Create File button, include the directory the filename. E.g. `222/English.txt`

In the folder for that comic, create a new `.txt` or `.md` file. Give it the name of the language as it should appear on the webpage. For example, the Spanish language file should be "Español.txt" or "Español.md".

Paste in the transcript.

HTML and Markdown formatting are allowed. The transcript will be run through a Markdown parser, so any special characters (e.g. &, <, >) will be automatically escaped.

# How to Find the Original English Transcripts

Due to the way the website is built, we can't include the English transcripts in this repository without either falling behind on pages as they're published or putting spoilers in this repository ahead of the unpublished pages. So, all English transcripts are included in the main website on the backend. This is why English transcripts can be present and viewable on the website without an "English.txt" file for a given page in this repository. However, if an "English.txt" or "English.md" file is added to this repository for a given page, it will override what's published on the website.

If you would like to access the Markdowned English transcript file that's on the backend of the main website, you can do so by going to the following URL: `https://www.tamberlanecomic.com/your_content/comics/<comic_number>/English.md` Make sure to replace `<comic_number>` with the number of the comic. For example, if you're looking for the transcript for Page 380, you will use the link <https://www.tamberlanecomic.com/your_content/comics/380/English.md>

English transcript before Page 366 used the filename `English.txt` instead, so if you can't find a transcript with the `.md` extension, try with `.txt`.
