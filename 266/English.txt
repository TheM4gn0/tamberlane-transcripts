ARTIE: Gather round and lend your ears, my kits, and we'll tell you a story.
HATTIE: A story that lives in the beat of your heart and the pulse of your blood.

ARTIE: Pay no attention to the flickering candle...
HATTIE: or the shadows creeping up the walls.

ARTIE: For you've heard their names before.
HATTIE: They stalk the dreams of kits the world round, every night.

HATTIE: With mouths full of mismatched teeth...

ARTIE: And endless legs that never tire, *no matter how far you run*...

ARTIE: Few dare speak their name, lest their attention turns to *you.*
ARTIE&HATTIE: Yes, my kits... We speak of... ***THE LONGWALKERS!***
