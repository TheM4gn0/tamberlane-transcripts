TIMMOTHY: Long ago, my very own ancestor, Nairobi, was torn between her family and the growing Sovereignty movement.

TIMMOTHY: Our chance at victory was dwindling, and we knew it. We needed all the help we could get.

TIMMOTHY: But her family had already lost so much. They begged her not to go. To stay *safe.*

TIMMOTHY: We are very familial creatures. 
TIMMOTHY: The pull of the hearth is *very* strong for ordinary meerkats.

TIMMOTHY: But Nairobi was no ordinary meerkat.
