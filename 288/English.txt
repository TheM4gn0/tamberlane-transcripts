JONAS: Nice out, isn't it? Crisp.
KIRA: Yeah. Nice to just hang out with you lot away from erryone else.

KIRA: I hate school trips. Everyone's all on your back all the time.

CUR: Yeah, but that prank was pretty funny, innit?
KIRA: I love it when they run around!
JONAS: Tchyeah!

CUR: I prolly shouldn't've tripped Piper, though. Didn't mean to actually hurt her...
KIRA: I *don't* love it when they cry.
JONAS: Yeah...

CUR: Ah, well. Serves her right for bein' a prig.
