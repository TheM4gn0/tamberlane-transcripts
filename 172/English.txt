TESS: It boils down to this, Belfry.

TESS: If you go to Abroad, you will be *banned* from Silver Sage.

TESS: Creatures *do* care, my Bel.
TESS: You were only a baby during the Great Outbreak. I *know* that.
TESS: But Abroad is Abroad. Nothing can change that.
TESS: If you ever go there, you can *never* come home.
TESS: And I will *never* see you again.

TESS: Belfry, I'm so sorry for how I've acted lately. I have no excuse!

TESS: But I'm scared, *so* scared, of losing my little bat.
